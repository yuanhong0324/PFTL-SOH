Due to a corrupted training data file caused by our project upload, we haven't found a solution yet. Therefore, we have uploaded the project to Google Drive, and you can access it via the following link: 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n7eDdo_22JHpbeMc0TnD6YXkl3Iiunkt/view?usp=sharing

All project files on Google Drive are undamaged and can be downloaded normally.

We will subsequently fix the issue of the corrupted data file on the GitHub page and upload the complete project files once the paper is officially accepted.
